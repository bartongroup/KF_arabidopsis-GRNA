    "One of the Bioinformatics refereees major concerns was the possible presence of rRNA expression remaining in our ribo-minus samples. This expression could be considerably variable and distorting our distribution analysis. To address this, we're going to re-run the analysis after removing reads that map to rRNA genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here I'm going to load the current [ensembl plants v40 Arabidopsis annotation](ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/plants/release-40/gff3/arabidopsis_thaliana]), filter it for rRNA genes, and then make a function that parses a bam file for reads that map in these regions, and filters them out, outputting a new bam files.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a notebook to test the subroutines. It'll then be run individually on each bam file and the matching fastqs."
